  Demonstate Programming to Interfaces 
 ======================================

  object of class Example1
  object of class Example2

  The objFactory delivers, via ExampleInterface pointers,
  objects that derive from ExampleInterface.  That
  interface provides a protocol for clients of all
  derived class objects, like Example1 and Example2,
  to use, without needing to bind to the concrete
  derived class of the objectthey are using.
